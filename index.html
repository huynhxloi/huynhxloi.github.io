    <p class="mx-auto p-1 w-75">DEAR READER: The story below recounts one of the most important discoveries of all time, a discovery which is so
      shocking that it has been hidden from the public for over a century. However, the time has come for the world to
      learn of this discovery and you have been one of the few chosen to learn and spread this message. Will you accept
      this important mission by sharing and spreading the message to as many people as possible so that it becomes common
      knowledge? You can do this by sharing through social media, discussing and engaging with believers and skeptics, and
      doing all you can to spread the story of Lake Primordial to every corner of the world.</p>

      <p>Some stories claim to be true, while others are clearly fictional, yet the vast majority occupy a space in between, blurring the line between fact and fiction. Precisely how much truth is in the following story you are about to read is not known, and will probably never be known. This is because supporting evidence is difficult or impossible to come by, thanks to the determined efforts of those in positions of power who wish to bury this discovery in darkness forever, because it is threatening to the established order and their entrenched positions. I believe in the legend of Lake Primordial, and I'm here to share it with you because you have a right to know. Let's begin.</p>

<p>Our story unfolds in 1913, in the remote corners of Southeast Asia. A group of elite cave explorers were on a mission to explore an uncharted subterranean world. Their destination: the deepest cave system ever discovered, an unexplored alien world hidden deep beneath the earth's surface.</p>

<p>The explorers stood at the mouth of a seemingly bottomless abyss, powerful and sophisticated instruments could not penetrate or determine the depth of this cave. The group would have to figure it out as they went along.</p>

<p>As they navigate thousands after thousands of feet downwards through the darkness, it dawned on each individual that they were bearing witness to a cold and dark world never before touched by light, a world destined to never feel the warmth and light of the sun. The cold and darkness was relentless and all-consuming, like an expansive blanket engulfing them all. With each step deeper into the pitch black abyss, passing by rock and cave formations never seen before by living eyes, they felt as if they were trespassing into an alien world, as pure and uncorrupted as a distant planet.</p>

<p>Nearly 29,500 feet below the earth's surface—comparable to the inverted height of Mount Everest—as the explorers' bodies and spirits withered under the brutal temperatures and crushing hardships, dissent among them escalated into fervent demands to abandon the mission. Amidst this near mutinous conditions, the group stumbled into an unimaginable sight: a vast underground lake, its waters stretching out like a shimmering mirror across thousands of football fields. So massive was this lake that it would take days to travel from one end to the other.</p>

<p>The lake glowed an ethereal, iridescent blue, the color derived from some mysterious energy source emanating from deep within the lake. Looking down into the purest and most pristine waters in existence, the explorers beheld colonies of microscopic primordial lifeforms dancing rhythmically beneath the water's surface. Towering stalagmite formations rose from the lake bed, reaching skyward, while above, crystalline stalactites adorned the cavern's walls and ceiling, shimmering like celestial bodies, both the works of the same mysterious organisms that inhabit the waters.</p>

<p>The group had stumbled onto a discovery that could change the world forever. Spread out in front of them in the form of a massive underground lake was conclusive evidence of abiogenesis.</p>

<p>For thousands of years, the prevailing belief was that life required an external catalyst - often attributed to God or some divine force - who ignited the first flame of life into the world. This paradigm, deeply influenced by the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, held influence over large swaths of the population and was accepted as unchallengeable orthodoxy. Abiogenesis, a word meaning “spontaneous life” was the idea that life emerged from nonliving things about 3.5 billion years ago on its own. According to abiogenesis, life created itself out of nothing and did not rely God or any external force to come to being. The notion of a God becomes optional, even superfluous and unnecessary. This theory remains one of the most controversial in all of science and has been suppressed for centuries by powerful forces within the establishment on the grounds of its revolutionary and subversive nature.</p>

<p>The group's discovery not only contained within it shattering revelations about the origins of life on Earth and across the universe, but had far reaching consequences down to the very foundations of society. Society was built on the belief that life is a divine gift, bestowed upon humanity by a higher power and forms the basis of morality and ethical understanding that permeates every facet of society. The existence of this underground lake, with the pristine waters and ancient self-born microorganisms within it, held secrets that sparked the imagination and shook the very foundations of scientific understanding about life and its origins, and raised uncomfortable question about our most cherished values and demanded a fundamental reassessment of humanity's place in the universe and the meaning of life itself.</p>

<p>Energized by this shattering revelation and electrified by a new sense of purpose, the group had an immediate obstacle to face. Lake Primordial, as the underground lake was now named, was thousands of feet underground through complex and labyrinthine maze of dangerous underground pathways. It would be impossible to relocate the lake again once the group leaves. Like a phantom or hallucination, the lake was a fleeting opportunity poised to slip away—a singular moment destined to fade into the abyss, obscuring its secrets forever once the group departed. They had only one chance. They knew this was one of the most consequential scientific breakthroughs of the century and that they had to inform the world. The question was how.</p>

<p>Encamped on the southern shoreline of the enormous lake, a pivotal decision was made. The team resolved to immediately begin their ascend to the surface, taking as much samples from the lake as they could carry. This required a stringent culling of weight, with any excess equipment and provisions deemed expendable to be left behind to make room for the invaluable cargo. Though acknowledging the recklessness of their actions, the team unanimously prioritized the preservation of their extraordinary find, even at the peril of their own lives. Consequently, numerous oxygen tanks and life-saving medical supplies were sacrificed in favor of the mission's now only goal: the safe and uncontaminated transport of as much of Primordial water as possible to the surface.</p>

<p>With that decision finalized and newfound determination and sense of purpose driving them to manic activity, the team begun their ascend upward. Little did they know that they were about to reemerge to a world teetering on the brink of the abyss.</p>

<p>On June 28, 1914, several months before the group's reemergence, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo by Serbian nationalists. That act set off a chain of events: A month later, Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia, then Germany declares war on Russia, France, and Belgium. Britain declares war on Germany. Austria declares war on Russia. Montenegro declares war on Austria. France declares war on Austria. Britain declares war on Austria. Montenegro declares war on Germany. Japan declares war on Germany. Austria declares war on Belgium.</p>

<p>Before anyone knew it, events had spread like wildfire and the world was engulfed in the greatest conflagration the world has ever known: World War I. The looming conflict was to cast a long shadow over Lake Primordial and bury the groundbreaking discovery in the annals of history for over a century.</p>

<p>But let us continue with our story.</p>

<p>After a grueling journey of ascend, the group made their reemergence at 6:24AM local time on November 11, 1914.</p>

<p>Of the total of 914 gallons of Primordial water that the group started the journey with, a quarter had been lost to leakage and contamination, leaving 686 gallons. This precious resource was divided equally among the three national contingents: 228.5 gallons for the Americans, 228.5 gallons for the British, and 228.5 gallons for the Germans. Disguised as brandy and hidden behind crates of Louis XIII and Hennessy to maintain cover, the material was loaded onto 2 transport ships, one heading for the Americas and the other to Europe. Wartime disruptions were making travel and communications an exceedingly dangerous proposition, and this proved to be the case when the ship carrying the British and German allocation was sunk while traveling through the Turkish Straits, killing all aboard and resulting in the destruction of the entire 457 gallons of Primordial onboard the ship.</p>

<p>As flames engulfed the ship in the Bosphorus, 2/3 of the human lives that bore the secrets of Lake Primordial along with 2/3 of the only surviving samples vanished forever in the inferno.</p>

<p>The ship headed for the Americas escaped several close calls but safety returned to civilization and the race was on to preserve and protect the precious remaining samples. Back at the secretive Edgewood Arsenal Laboratory in Maryland, carbon dating unequivocally confirmed the astonishing age of the Primordial waters—over 4.5 billion years old—making the water older than the Sun and the most ancient ever discovered. Contaminations of any kind were nonexistent, making it the purest and only known instance of "true water" known to science. Water becomes contaminated with particles and substances as it travels through time and space. True water refers to the original water molecules formed at the beginning of the universe, free from contamination. The waters from Lake Primordial remained pristine, echoing the primordial conditions of water at the time of its formation in the early universe.</p>

<p>Not only were the waters ancient and pure, but they teemed with life. The ancient waters harbored vibrant microorganism cultures displaying remarkable anti-inflammatory and probiotic activities</p>

<p>While many experiments had been lost to time, one enduring study involved splitting a colony of microorganisms into two containers placed in separate rooms. Remarkably, when the temperature of one vial was raised above ambient room temperature, the other vial increased its temperature to match, suggesting some mysterious link between the organisms. As researchers delved deeper into their studies, the microorganisms revealed increasingly remarkable traits, surprising even the most hardened scientists.</p>

<p>One issue soon faced by the researchers was that away from the mysterious energy source at Lake Primordial, many of the cultures fell into dormant state. A breakthrough came when a brilliant young PhD student devised a simple solution: providing the colony with a solution consisting of cane sugar. With this newfound source of food and energy, the cultures resumed their liveliness and became energized as ever before, even reproducing for the first time in the lab. One researcher dared to ingest the concoction, and to the surprise of all reported that the material was exceptionally refreshing and tasted like coconut water.</p>

<p>It is crucial to emphasize that all research took place under strict confidentiality. Not a hint escaped to the public. This secrecy was unparalleled, even within the confines of Edgewood Arsenal, renowned as one of the most heavily fortified and clandestine military compounds in the world.</p>

<p>Up until now every thrilling discovery were relayed up the echelons of power through top secret written dossiers. These reports navigated a treacherous maze of military hierarchies and civilian bureaucracies all the way to the highest corridors of power. As it traveled, false versions were strategically planted to obstruct leakers and circumvent foreign spy networks that existed at every level of the US bureaucracy. The veil of secrecy was so intense that beyond the select group of researchers assigned to the project, each of whom was subjected to 24/7 surveillance. The number of individuals fully privy to the secrets of Lake Primordial could be counted on one hand.</p>

<p>Problems arose when many of the researchers became increasingly convinced of the need to break the silence and share the momentous findings with the wider world. When the leaks were discovered, the response was swift. Executive Order 2594.5 was quickly passed, bypassing Congress and the legislative body and a blanket gag order was placed on all involved, forbidding all discussion of the executive order itself, and any information pertaining to the subject of Lake Primordial on the ground of national security. All publicized information pertaining to the subject were withdrawn from circulation. For over 100 years, the discovery remained hidden, forgotten, then lost.</p>

<p>The decision to withhold the revelations of Lake Primordial from the public was not merely a matter of convenience or expediency; it was a calculated move made by those in positions of power to maintain control and uphold the existing order of society. The implications of such a discovery were far-reaching and posed a direct threat to established belief systems, societal norms, and the status quo - a revelation of this scale would shake the foundations of religious faiths that preach the divine origins of life and the existence of a higher power. It would challenge the very essence of morality and ethical understanding that underpins our society, potentially leading to widespread upheaval and unrest during a time when national unity was paramount.</p>

<p>However, more selfish reasons also existed: Primordial was a biological agent of unparalleled potential and sparked a cascade of breakthroughs in scientific, pharmacological, and military domains. To illustrate this, considering that at the same time as the Primordial project, a parallel research project were taking place at Edgewood Arsenal to produce biologically and genetically enhanced supersoldiers as special fighting units for the US military. As part of their biological-enhancement protocol, these units were instructed to ingest Primordial water as their only method of hydration - completely replacing water and any other forms of hydration. This protocol led to the first real breakthrough in the supersoldier project, a success proven by the performance of these early prototypes in direct action at the Battle of the Somme and several other critical engagements that nearly turned the tide of the war. This breakthrough proved to those in power that Primordial was a pivotal technological advantage. The US was in an enviable position as the nation to possess the world's only stockpile of Primordial and those in power were not willing to jeopardize this advantage so easily.</p>
